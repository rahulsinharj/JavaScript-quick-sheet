# Regular Expressions:

* Regular expressions are the patterns that are used to match character combinations in strings. 
* Regular expressions are a powerful way of doing search and replace in strings. 
* It is a small language which is a part of many programming languages like JavaScript, Python, and Java. 
* Regular expression allows us to check a string of characters like a password for patterns, to see if the set password matches with the pattern defined by that regular expression. 
* Syntax: `/pattern/modifiers;`
* Some commonly used methods:
    1. exec(): This method will executes a search for a match in a string. It returns an array of information or null on a mismatch.
    2. test(): This method tests for a match in a string. It returns true or false.
    3. match(): This method will return an array containing all of the matches, including capturing groups, or null if no match is found. 
    4. search(): This method will tests for a match in a string. It returns the index of the match, or -1 if the search fails.
    5. replace(): This method will executes a search for a match in a string, and replaces the matched substring with a replacement substring. 
    6. split(): This method uses a regular expression or a fixed string to break a string into an array of substrings.
    
* Example snippets:

```
let reg = /sanya/; // This is a regular expression literal in js.
reg = /sanya/g; // g means global.
// reg = /sanya/i; // i means case insensitive.

// console.log(reg);
// console.log(reg.source);

let s = "My name is sanya. ";

// Functions to match expressions
// 1. exec() - This function will return an array for match or null for no match
let result = reg.exec(s);
// result = reg.exec(s);
// console.log(result);
// result = reg.exec(s);
// console.log(result); ---> We can use multiple exec with global flag

// if (result) {
//     console.log(result);
//     console.log(result.input);
//     console.log(result.index);
// }

// 2. test() - Returns true or false
let result2 = reg.test(s);
// console.log(result2); --> This will only print true if the "reg" is there in the string "s"

// 3. match() - It will return an array of results or null
// let result3 = reg.match(s) ---> This is wrong!!
let result3 = s.match(reg) // ---> This is right
// console.log(result3);

// 4. search() - Returns index of first match else -1
// let result4 = reg.search(s) ---> This is wrong!!
let result4 = s.search(reg) // ---> This is right
// console.log(result4);

// 5. replace() - Returns new replaced string with all the replacements 
// (if no flag is given, first match will be replaced)
let result5 = s.replace(reg, 'abc');
console.log(result5);

```

## Metacharacters in regular expressions:
* Metacharacters are the building blocks of regular expressions. 
* Characters in Regular expression are understood to be either a metacharacter with a special meaning or a regular character with a literal meaning. 
* Some of the common metacharacters in regular expressions are:

 |Character|Explanation|
 |---------|-----------|
 |. |This metacharacter allows any character.|
 |+ |This character allows one or more preceding term.|
 |* |This character allows zero or more preceding term.|
 |? |This character allows zero or one preceding term.|
 |\.|This character allows a period(.) in the text.|
 |\/|This character allows forward slash in the text.|
 |\*|This character allows asterik in the text.|
 |\+|This character allows Plus sign in the text.|
 |\?|This character allows question mark in the text.|
 |^ |The string should begin with the specified word written after this character.|
 |$ |The string should end with the specified word written before this character.|

<hr/>

## Character sets:
 * Unlike the dot(.), which matches any single character, character sets enable us to match specific characters and character ranges.
 * Several characters or character classes inside square brackets […] means "search for any character among given." Brackets and sets are used to find a range of characters. 
 * #### Sets:
     * For instance, [aeio] means any of the 4 characters: 'a', 'e' , 'i', or 'o'. That is called a set. Sets can be used in a regular expressions along with regular characters:
 * #### Ranges:
     * Square brackets may also contain character ranges. For instance, [a-z] is a character in range from a to z, and [0-9] is a digit from 0 to 9.
 * #### Excluding ranges:
     * Besides normal ranges, there are "excluding" ranges that look like [^…]. They are denoted by a caret character ^ at the start and match any character except the given ones.
  
## Quantifiers:
* Quantifier matches a number of instances of a character, group, or character class in a string. 
* It is appended to a character and specifies how many characters we need. 
* Following is the table of quantifiers, along with its description:

 |Quantifier|Description|
 |----------|-----------|
 |* |It matches zero or more times.|
 |+ |It matches one or more times.|
 |? |It matches zero or one time.|
 |{ x }|It matches exactly x times.|
 |{x ,}|It matches at least x times.|
 |{ x, y }|It matches from x to y times.|
