## Math Object:
 * It is used to perform mathematical tasks. 
 * It is a built-in static object, so we do not need to instantiate it. 
 * We can access all its properties and methods directly. 
 * Math object works with the Number type. 
 * Unlike many other global objects, Math is not a constructor. 
 * We refer to the constant pi as Math.PI and we call the cos function as Math.cos(x), where x is the method's argument.
 * List of commonly used Math method:
 
    |Method|Description|
    |------|-----------|
    |abs()|It will return the absolute value of the given number.|
    |acos()|It will return the arccosine of the given number in radians.|
    |asin()|It will return the arcsine of the given number in radians.|
    |atan()|It will return the arc-tangent of the given number in radians.|
    |cbrt()|It will return the cube root of the given number.|
    |ceil()|It will return a smallest integer value, greater than or equal to the given number.|
    |cos()|It will return the cosine of the given number.|
    |cosh()|It will return the hyperbolic cosine of the given number.|
    |exp()|It will return the exponential form of the given number.|
    |floor()|It will return the largest integer value, lower than or equal to the given number.|
    |hypot()|It will return the square root of sum of the squares of given numbers.|
    |log()|It will return the natural logarithm of a number.|
    |max()|It will return the maximum value of the given numbers.|
    |min()|It will return the minimum value of the given numbers.|
    |pow()|It will return the value of base to the power of exponent.|
    |random()|It will return the random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).|
    |round()|It will return the closest integer value of the given number.|
    |sin()|It will return the sine of the given number.|
    |sinh()|It will return the hyperbolic sine of the given number.|
    |sqrt()|It will return the square root of the given number.|
    |tan()|It will return the tangent of the given number.|
    |tanh()|It will return the hyperbolic tangent of the given number.|
    |trunc()||It will return an integer part of the given number.|

## Date Object:

 * The Date object is a built-in datatype into the JavaScript language. 
 * The Date object is used to deal with dates and times in JavaScript.
 * Once a Date object is created, many methods allow us to operate on it. 
 * Most methods allow us to get and set the month, day, year, hour, minute, and second using either local time or universal time. 
 * There are four ways of instantiating a date:
    ``` 
    let d = new Date();
    let d = new Date(milliseconds);
    let d = new Date(dateString);
    let d = new Date(year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds);
    ```

 * Metods availablle to obtain a date in various formats and perform time zone conversions:
   |Method|Description|
   |------|-----------|
   |getDate()|return the day of the month (from 1-31)|
   |getDay()|return the day of the week (from 0-6)|
   |getFullYear()|return the year|
   |getHours()|return the hour (from 0-23)|
   |getMilliseconds()|return the milliseconds (from 0-999)|
   |getMinutes()|return the minutes (from 0-59)|
   |getMonth()|return the month (from 0-11)|
   |getSeconds()|return the seconds (from 0-59)|
   |getTime()|return the number of milliseconds since midnight Jan 1 1970, and a specified date|
   |getTimezoneOffset()|return the time difference between UTC time and local time, in minutes|
   |getUTCDate()|return the day of the month, according to universal time (from 1-31)|
   |getUTCHours()|return the hour, according to universal time (from 0-23)|
   |getUTCMilliseconds()|return the milliseconds, according to universal time (from 0-999)|
   |getUTCMinutes()|return the minutes, according to universal time (from 0-59)|
   |getUTCMonth()|return the month, according to universal time (from 0-11)|
   |getUTCSeconds()|return the seconds, according to universal time (from 0-59)|
   |setDate()|set the day of the month of a date object|
   |setFullYear()|set the year of a date object|
   |setHours()|set the hour of a date object|
   |setMilliseconds()|set the milliseconds of a date object|
   |setMinutes()|set the minutes of a date object|
   |setMonth()|set the month of a date object|
   |setUTCHours()|set the hour of a date object, according to universal time|
   |toDateString()|convert the date portion of a Date object into a readable string|
   |toLocaleString()|convert a Date object to a string, using locale conventions|
   |toString()|convert a Date object to a string|
   |toTimeString()|convert the time portion of a Date object to a string|
   |toUTCString()|convert a Date object to a string, according to universal time|
   |UTC()|return the number of milliseconds in a date since midnight of January 1, 1970, according to UTC time|
   |valueOf()|return the primitive value of a Date object|
