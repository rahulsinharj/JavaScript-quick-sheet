# Object Oriented Programming in JavaScript:

* The basic idea of object-oriented programming is that objects are used to model real world things that we want to represent inside our programs. 
* We can also describe OOP as the OOP provides a simple way to access functionality that would otherwise be hard or impossible to make use of.


## Objects:
* It can contain related code and data, representing information about the thing we are trying to model, and functionality that we want it to have. 
* Object data is stored neatly inside an object package, making it easy to structure and access. 
* JavaScript is a powerful programming language that supports Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). 
* In JavaScript, objects created using object literal are singletons. 
    * This means when we made a change in an object, it affects the entire object script. 
    * Whereas if an object is created using the constructor function, then the change will not affect the object throughout the script. 
    * However, if we have to create multiple instances of a structure and perform operations based on predefined values, then we should use a function constructor.
    * Objects created using the constructor function:
         * The object that is defined with a function constructor lets us have multiple instances of that object. 
         * If the change is made to one instance, it will not affect other instances. 
         * As we know that the constructor is essentially a function that acts as a blueprint for creating objects. 
         * A convention for declaring constructors is always to capitalize its function name. 
       
* "new" keyword:
     * To create a new object instance, we use the "new" keyword to create an object based on a constructor. 
     * The new keyword creates a new empty object. 
     * It binds property or function, which is declared with this keyword to the new object.

## Object Prototype In Javascript: 
  * All objects in JavaScript are instances of Object. 
  * A typical object inherits properties from Object.prototype. 
  * The Object.prototype object has many built-in methods and properties such as toString(), valueOf(), etc.
  * All objects see the object prototype object changes through prototype chaining unless the properties and methods subject to those changes are overridden further along the prototype chain. `This is a very dangerous mechanism to override or extend object behavior.`
  * JavaScript is a prototype-based language. Whenever we create a function using JavaScript, the JavaScript engine adds a prototype property inside a function. 
  * The prototype property is an object where we can attach methods and properties in a prototype object, which enables all the other objects to inherit these methods and properties. 
 
### Methods and descriptions: 
  * The prototype object includes many properties and methods. Some of them are:
      * hasOwnProperty(): It will return a boolean indicating whether an object contains the specified property as a direct property of that object and not inherited through the prototype chain.
      * isPrototypeOf(): It will return a boolean indicating whether the specified object is in the prototype chain of the object, this method is called upon.
      * propertyIsEnumerable(): It will return a boolean that indicates whether the specified property is enumerable or not.
      * toLocaleString(): It will return the string in the local format.
      * toString(): It will return the string.
      * valueOf() :It will return the primitive value of the specified object.

 ### Use of Prototype:
   * JavaScript is using the prototype object in two things. First, one is to find properties and methods of an object, and the other is to implement inheritance in JavaScript.

## Prototype Inheritance:
  * JavaScript is a prototype-based language. 
  * The object's properties and methods can be shared through generalized objects that can be cloned and extended. This sharing is known as prototypical inheritance.
  * `Every object in JavaScript has an internal property called prototype.`
  
  ### Inheritance: 
   * Inheritance let the objects to share each other's properties. In other words, Inheritance is the process by which one object can be based on another.
  
  ### Prototype Inheritance:
   * When we try to access a property or any object's method, the JavaScript will first search on the object itself, and then it will search the object's prototype if not found.
   * If, after checking both the object and its prototype still no match is found, JavaScript will check the linked object prototype and continue searching until the end of the prototype chain is reached. 
   * Object.prototype is at the end of the prototype chain. 
   * All the objects inherit the properties and methods of Object. 
   * When we try to search beyond the end of the chain, results in null. 
   * There are different ways to create an object in JavaScript:
      1. Object literal (Already discussed above)
      2. Function constructor (Already discussed above)
      3. The create() method:
         * The Object.create() method using an existing object as the prototype, creates a new object. The syntax is: `Object.create(proto, [propertiesObject])`
         * To create inheritance between function constructors, call the parent constructor using call or link the prototype of the child constructor to the parent constructor prototype.
           * #### Using call to chain constructors for an object:   
              * The call() allows the method or function belonging to one object to be assigned and called for another object.
              * This method provides a new value of this to the method or function. 
              * With call(), we can write a method once and then inherit it in another object without rewriting the new object's method.
              
           * #### Manually set the constructor:
              * The constructor property is used to return a reference to the object constructor function that created the instance object. 
              * We mostly use this property to define a function-constructor function by calling it with a new and prototype-inherits chain.

## ES6 Classes and Inheritance:
  
  ### ES6 Classes:
  * ES6 Classes are the common JavaScript pattern of getting the class-like inheritance hierarchies using functions and prototypes. 
  * They are effectively simple compared to prototype-based OO, offering a convenient declarative form for class patterns that encourage interoperability.
  
  ### Constructors:
  * The constructor method's purpose is to initialize an instance to a valid state, and it will be called automatically, so we cannot forget to initialize our objects. 
  * The constructor function is an object blueprint. 
  
  ### Defining Methods:
  * The common practice is to assign methods directly to the prototype instead of in the initialization. 
  * But, with classes, this syntax is simplified, and we can add the method to the class. 
  * Using the method definition introduced in ES6 JavaScript, defining a method is an even more easy and concise process.
  
  ### Inheritance:
  * Inheritance is one of the most important concepts of object-oriented programming. 
  * The significant advantage of using ES6 classes over pre-ES6 functions is that class definitions are cleaner and easy to inherit. 
  * Without writing prototype code for an inheritance, class inheritance in JavaScript is easier and similar to other object-oriented languages like Java. 
  
  ### Extending a Class:
  * The most useful feature of constructor functions and classes is that they can be extended into new object blueprints based on the parent. 
  * Before es6, the new constructor functions can be created from the parent using the call() method. 
  * However, with the help of ES6 classes, the super keyword is used in place of the call to access the parent functions.

  ### Example code snippet:
  ```
   class Employee {
       constructor(givenName, givenExperience, givenDivision) {
           this.name = givenName;
           this.experience = givenExperience;
           this.division = givenDivision;
       }

      slogan(){
           return `I am ${this.name} and this company is the best`;
      }

      joiningYear(){
           return 2020 - this.experience;
      }

       static add(a, b){
           return a + b;
      }
   }

   class Programmer extends Employee{
       constructor(givenName, givenExperience, givenDivision, language, github){
           super(givenName, givenExperience, givenDivision);
           this.language = language;
           this.github = github;
       }

       favoriteLanguage(){
           if (this.language == 'python'){
               return 'Python';
           }
           else{
             return 'JavaScript';
           }
     }

       static multiply(a, b){
          return a * b;
       }
   }

   sanya = new Programmer("Sanya", 1, "XYZ", "JS", "sanya2508")
   console.log(sanya);
   console.log(sanya.favoriteLanguage());
   console.log(Programmer.multiply(5, 7));
   ```
