# Object Oriented Programming in JavaScript:

* The basic idea of object-oriented programming is that objects are used to model real world things that we want to represent inside our programs. 
* We can also describe OOP as the OOP provides a simple way to access functionality that would otherwise be hard or impossible to make use of.


## Objects:
* It can contain related code and data, representing information about the thing we are trying to model, and functionality that we want it to have. 
* Object data is stored neatly inside an object package, making it easy to structure and access. 
* JavaScript is a powerful programming language that supports Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). 
* In JavaScript, objects created using object literal are singletons. 
    * This means when we made a change in an object, it affects the entire object script. 
    * Whereas if an object is created using the constructor function, then the change will not affect the object throughout the script. 
    * However, if we have to create multiple instances of a structure and perform operations based on predefined values, then we should use a function constructor.
    * Objects created using the constructor function:
         * The object that is defined with a function constructor lets us have multiple instances of that object. 
         * If the change is made to one instance, it will not affect other instances. 
         * As we know that the constructor is essentially a function that acts as a blueprint for creating objects. 
         * A convention for declaring constructors is always to capitalize its function name. 
       
* "new" keyword:
     * To create a new object instance, we use the "new" keyword to create an object based on a constructor. 
     * The new keyword creates a new empty object. 
     * It binds property or function, which is declared with this keyword to the new object.

## Object Prototype In Javascript: 
  * All objects in JavaScript are instances of Object. 
  * A typical object inherits properties from Object.prototype. 
  * The Object.prototype object has many built-in methods and properties such as toString(), valueOf(), etc.
  * All objects see the object prototype object changes through prototype chaining unless the properties and methods subject to those changes are overridden further along the prototype chain. `This is a very dangerous mechanism to override or extend object behavior.`
  * JavaScript is a prototype-based language. Whenever we create a function using JavaScript, the JavaScript engine adds a prototype property inside a function. 
  * The prototype property is an object where we can attach methods and properties in a prototype object, which enables all the other objects to inherit these methods and properties. 
 
### Methods and descriptions: 
  * The prototype object includes many properties and methods. Some of them are:
      * hasOwnProperty(): It will return a boolean indicating whether an object contains the specified property as a direct property of that object and not inherited through the prototype chain.
      * isPrototypeOf(): It will return a boolean indicating whether the specified object is in the prototype chain of the object, this method is called upon.
      * propertyIsEnumerable(): It will return a boolean that indicates whether the specified property is enumerable or not.
      * toLocaleString(): It will return the string in the local format.
      * toString(): It will return the string.
      * valueOf() :It will return the primitive value of the specified object.

 ### Use of Prototype:
   * JavaScript is using the prototype object in two things. First, one is to find properties and methods of an object, and the other is to implement inheritance in JavaScript.
