## Iterators:
`Object that knows how to access items from a collection one at a time, while keeping track of its current position within that sequence.`
  * Iterators are a new way to loop over any collection in JavaScript.
  * Iterator  is an object that allows us to traverse over a list or collection. 
  * Iterators' purpose is to define the sequences and implement the iterator protocol that returns an object by using a next() method that contains the value and done.
     * done: It is a boolean value indicating whether any more elements in the sequence could be iterated upon.
     * value: It is the current element of the sequence. 
  * If there are elements present in the sequence that could be iterated, then the value contains the next element and done is set to false:
  * `{ value: 'next value', done: false }`
  * If we call the next() method after the last value has been returned, then the next() returns the result object as follows:
  * `{done: true: value: undefined}`
  * Here the value of the done property, which is true, indicates that there is no more value to return, and the value of the property is set to undefined.
  * Example snippet:
    ```
    function myIterable() {
        let counter = 0;
        return {
            next:function(){
                if (counter < 5) {
                counter++;
                return { done: false, value: counter };
                } else {
                return { done: true, value: undefined };
              }
           }
       }
    }
    ```

## Generator:
  * A generator is a special kind of function that was introduced in ES6. 
  * In JavaScript, once we execute a function, it has to be executed entirely. 
  * But, generator functions enable us to create functions that another code can enter multiple times. 
  * Nothing from outside of the generator function can make it pause. 
  * Generator function pauses itself when it runs into a yield expression. 
  * Once the execution reaches the yield expression, the generator cannot continue execution on its own. 
  * Something from outside has to continue its execution.
  * Another important difference between generators and normal functions is that generator functions can produce multiple values during its execution. Hence, they can generate a sequence of values, not all at once, but on a per request basis. At every request, the generator function gives us a value until it reaches the end of its execution. Once that happens, the done flag will be set to true. 
  * ### Here is the syntax of defining the generator function:
    ```
    function* myGenerator(){
    //code
    }
    ```
  * ### Yield:
     * The yield keyword pauses the generator function execution, and the value of the expression following the yield keyword is returned to the generator's caller. 
     * It acts as a generator-based version of the return keyword. 
     * In the following example, to pause the generator's execution, we use the statement yield.:
       ```
       function* awesomeGenerator(){
       yield 'Hello World' // We pause the execution here
       console.log('We are back again') // When we resume, we are here
       }
       ```
  * ### next() method:
     * A generator gives us the next() method, which is used to resume the execution. 
     * This method returns an object with two properties. 
     * These are value and done:
       ```
       {
        value: [ next value ],
        done: [ true if we reach the end, else false]
       }
       ```
   * ### Example snippet:
      ```
      function* myGenerator() {
        yield 1;
        yield 2;
      }
      let iterator = myGenerator();
      let result;
      do { 
        result = iterator.next();
        console.log(result);
      } while (!result.done);
      
      //Output:-
      //{value: 1, done: false}
      //{value: 2, done: false}
      //{value: undefined, done: true}
      ```
      * Here, when we first call the generator function, it returns us iterator object. 
      * When we call the next() for the first time, it starts executing the generator function, and it yields the first value: 1. 
      * Furthermore, calling it for the second time gives us the second and last value 2. 
      * Finally, the third call returns no value, and the done is set to true, which means that we have finished iterating through the generator.
