## Iterators:
`Object that knows how to access items from a collection one at a time, while keeping track of its current position within that sequence.`
  * Iterators are a new way to loop over any collection in JavaScript.
  * Iterator  is an object that allows us to traverse over a list or collection. 
  * Iterators' purpose is to define the sequences and implement the iterator protocol that returns an object by using a next() method that contains the value and done.
     * done: It is a boolean value indicating whether any more elements in the sequence could be iterated upon.
     * value: It is the current element of the sequence. 
  * If there are elements present in the sequence that could be iterated, then the value contains the next element and done is set to false:
  * `{ value: 'next value', done: false }`
  * If we call the next() method after the last value has been returned, then the next() returns the result object as follows:
  * `{done: true: value: undefined}`
  * Here the value of the done property, which is true, indicates that there is no more value to return, and the value of the property is set to undefined.
  * Example snippet:
    ```
    function myIterable() {
        let counter = 0;
        return {
            next:function(){
                if (counter < 5) {
                counter++;
                return { done: false, value: counter };
                } else {
                return { done: true, value: undefined };
              }
           }
       }
    }
    ```

## Generator:
  * A generator is a special kind of function that was introduced in ES6. 
  * In JavaScript, once we execute a function, it has to be executed entirely. 
  * But, generator functions enable us to create functions that another code can enter multiple times. 
  * Nothing from outside of the generator function can make it pause. 
  * Generator function pauses itself when it runs into a yield expression. 
  * Once the execution reaches the yield expression, the generator cannot continue execution on its own. 
  * Something from outside has to continue its execution.
  * Another important difference between generators and normal functions is that generator functions can produce multiple values during its execution. Hence, they can generate a sequence of values, not all at once, but on a per request basis. At every request, the generator function gives us a value until it reaches the end of its execution. Once that happens, the done flag will be set to true. 
  * ### Here is the syntax of defining the generator function:
    ```
    function* myGenerator(){
    //code
    }
    ```
  * ### Yield:
     * The yield keyword pauses the generator function execution, and the value of the expression following the yield keyword is returned to the generator's caller. 
     * It acts as a generator-based version of the return keyword. 
     * In the following example, to pause the generator's execution, we use the statement yield.:
       ```
       function* awesomeGenerator(){
       yield 'Hello World' // We pause the execution here
       console.log('We are back again') // When we resume, we are here
       }
       ```
  * ### next() method:
     * A generator gives us the next() method, which is used to resume the execution. 
     * This method returns an object with two properties. 
     * These are value and done:
       ```
       {
        value: [ next value ],
        done: [ true if we reach the end, else false]
       }
       ```
   * ### Example snippet:
      ```
      function* myGenerator() {
        yield 1;
        yield 2;
      }
      let iterator = myGenerator();
      let result;
      do { 
        result = iterator.next();
        console.log(result);
      } while (!result.done);
      
      //Output:-
      //{value: 1, done: false}
      //{value: 2, done: false}
      //{value: undefined, done: true}
      ```
      * Here, when we first call the generator function, it returns us iterator object. 
      * When we call the next() for the first time, it starts executing the generator function, and it yields the first value: 1. 
      * Furthermore, calling it for the second time gives us the second and last value 2. 
      * Finally, the third call returns no value, and the done is set to true, which means that we have finished iterating through the generator.

## Maps:
  * Maps are a new object type that allows us to store collections of key-value pairs. 
  * Map keys can be of any type, even objects or functions. 
  * In the case of maps, it is also easy to get the size of a map, whereas, it is not as straightforward in case of objects. 
  * Along with that, in maps, we can iterate in the order in which the values were added.
  * Syntax: `let mymap= new Map([iterable])`
  * Parameter:
     * iterable - It is any iterable object whose values are stored as key, value pair. Providing parameters is optional. If the parameter is not specified, then a new map is created Empty.
     * Returns: A new Map object.
   * ### Methods and Properties of Maps:
      * size: It returns the number of elements or the key-value pairs in the map.
      * set(): This method adds the key and value to the Map Object. 
         * Syntax: `mymap1.set(x, y);`
         * "x" is the key of the element to be added to the Map and "y" is the value of the element to be added to the Map. It returns a Map object.
      * has(): This method returns a boolean value depending on whether the specified key is present or not. 
         * Syntax: `mymap1.has(x);`
         * Here "x" is the key of the element to checked. It will return true if the element with the specified key is present or else returns false. 
      * get(): This method returns the value of the corresponding key. 
         * Syntax: `map1.get(x);`
         * Here "x" is the key, whose value is to be returned. It will return the value associated with the key if it is present in Map, otherwise returns undefined.
      * delete(): This method deletes both the key as well as a value from the map. 
         * Syntax: `map1.delete(k);`
         * Here "k" is the key which is to be deleted from the map. It will return true if the value is found and deleted from the map; otherwise, it returns false.
      * clear(): This method will remove all the elements from the Map object. 
         * Syntax: `map1.clear();`
         * It requires no parameters and return undefined.

## Sets:
 * A set is a collection of unique items. 
 * In set, no element can be repeated. 
 * The set in ES6 are ordered, elements of the set can be iterated in the insertion order. 
 * The power of the set is that it can store any types of values, whether primitive or objects.
 * Syntax: `let myset=new Set([iterable]);`
    * Here, iterable is an object whose all elements are added to the new set created. 
    * In set, the parameter is optional. 
    * If the parameter is not specified or null is passed then a new set created is empty. 
    * It returns a new set object. 
 * ### Methods of the set:
    * add(): This method adds the new element with a specified value at the end of the Set object. Here is the syntax: Here “x” is a value to be added to the set. And its returns set object.
    *  delete(): This method deletes an element with the specified value from the Set object. 
       * Syntax: `set1.delete(x);` 
       * Here “x” is a value to be deleted from the set. This method returns true if the value is successfully deleted from the set else returns false.
    * clear(): This method removes all the element from the set. 
       * Syntax: set1.clear();
       * In this method, no parameter is needed, and it returns undefined.
    * entries(): This method returns an iterator object which contains an array having the entries of the set, in the insertion order. 
       * Syntax: set1.entries();
       * This method does not need any parameter. It returns an iterator object that contains an array of [value, value] for every element of the set, in the insertion order. 
    * has(): This method returns true if the specified value is present in the Set object. 
       * Syntax: set1.has(x);
       * Here “x” is the value to be searched in the Set. This method returns true if the value is present else it returns false.
    * values(): This method returns all the values from the Set in the same insertion order. 
       * Syntax: set1.values();
       * No parameters are needed in this method. An iterator object is returned that contains all the values of the set in the same order as they are inserted. 
    * keys() – This method returns all the values from the Set in the insertion order. keys() is similar to the values() in case of Sets. 
       * Syntax: set1.keys();
       * No parameters are needed in this method. An iterator object returned that contains all the values of the set in the same order as they are inserted.
