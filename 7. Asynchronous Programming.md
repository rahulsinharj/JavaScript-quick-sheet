## Asynchronous Programming:
  
  ### Synchronous and asynchronous programming: 
   * In `synchronous programming`, one thing happens at a time. When we call a function that performs a long-running action, it returns a result when the action has finished. This stops the program for the time the action takes. 
   * In contrast, `asynchronous programming` allows multiple things to happen at the same time. When we start an action, the program continues to run. When the action finishes, the program is informed and gets the result.

## AJAX:
 * Ajax stands for `Asynchronous JavaScript And XML`. 
 * Ajax loads the data from the server and update the parts of a web page selectively without reloading the whole page. 
 * It is a technique for creating faster, and more interactive web applications with the help of XML, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
 * It is a web browser technology which is independent of web server software.
 * AJAX use the built-in browser `XMLHttpRequest (XHR)` objects to send and receive information to and from a web server asynchronously, in the background, without blocking the page or interfering with the user's experience.
 * Ajax uses XHTML for the content, CSS for designing, along with Document Object Model and JavaScript for dynamic content display. 
 * Before AJAX technology, the web applications used to transmit information to and from the server using synchronous requests. 
 * ### How Does AJAX Work?
      * JavaScript and XML combine to make asynchronous updating happen through the use of something called an XMLHttpRequest (XHR) object. 
      * When the user visits a web page which is designed using AJAX technology, and a prescribed event occurs (a button, or fills out a form) the JavaScript creates an XMLHttpRequest (XHR) object, which then transfers data in an XML format between a web browser and a web. 
      * The XMLHttpRequest(XHR) object sends a request for updated page data to the web server, the server process the request, a response is created at server-side and sent back to the browser, which then uses JavaScript to process the response and display it on the screen as updated content.

## Callback Function:
   * A callback is a function that is executed after another function that has finished executing. 
   * As we have studied earlier that functions are objects. Functions can take functions as arguments and can be returned by other functions. 
   * Functions that take another function as an argument are called higher-order functions. 
   * So, the callback function can also be defined as any function that is passed as an argument.
   * ### Why do we need Callbacks?
      * Callbacks are used to make sure that a function is not going to execute before a task is completed but will execute right after the task has completed. 
      * It helps us develop asynchronous JavaScript code and keeps us safe from future errors.
      * In JavaScript, the way to create a callback function is to pass it as a parameter to another function, and then to call it back right after something has happened or some task is completed.
