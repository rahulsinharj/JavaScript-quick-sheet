## Asynchronous Programming:
  
  ### Synchronous and asynchronous programming: 
   * In `synchronous programming`, one thing happens at a time. When we call a function that performs a long-running action, it returns a result when the action has finished. This stops the program for the time the action takes. 
   * In contrast, `asynchronous programming` allows multiple things to happen at the same time. When we start an action, the program continues to run. When the action finishes, the program is informed and gets the result.

## AJAX:
 * Ajax stands for `Asynchronous JavaScript And XML`. 
 * Ajax loads the data from the server and update the parts of a web page selectively without reloading the whole page. 
 * It is a technique for creating faster, and more interactive web applications with the help of XML, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
 * It is a web browser technology which is independent of web server software.
 * AJAX use the built-in browser `XMLHttpRequest (XHR)` objects to send and receive information to and from a web server asynchronously, in the background, without blocking the page or interfering with the user's experience.
 * Ajax uses XHTML for the content, CSS for designing, along with Document Object Model and JavaScript for dynamic content display. 
 * Before AJAX technology, the web applications used to transmit information to and from the server using synchronous requests. 
 * ### How Does AJAX Work?
      * JavaScript and XML combine to make asynchronous updating happen through the use of something called an XMLHttpRequest (XHR) object. 
      * When the user visits a web page which is designed using AJAX technology, and a prescribed event occurs (a button, or fills out a form) the JavaScript creates an XMLHttpRequest (XHR) object, which then transfers data in an XML format between a web browser and a web. 
      * The XMLHttpRequest(XHR) object sends a request for updated page data to the web server, the server process the request, a response is created at server-side and sent back to the browser, which then uses JavaScript to process the response and display it on the screen as updated content.

## Callback Function:
   * A callback is a function that is executed after another function that has finished executing. 
   * As we have studied earlier that functions are objects. Functions can take functions as arguments and can be returned by other functions. 
   * Functions that take another function as an argument are called higher-order functions. 
   * So, the callback function can also be defined as any function that is passed as an argument.
   * ### Why do we need Callbacks?
      * Callbacks are used to make sure that a function is not going to execute before a task is completed but will execute right after the task has completed. 
      * It helps us develop asynchronous JavaScript code and keeps us safe from future errors.
      * In JavaScript, the way to create a callback function is to pass it as a parameter to another function, and then to call it back right after something has happened or some task is completed.

<hr/>


## Promises:
  * Callback functions were initially used to handle asynchronous operations. 
  * However, callbacks functions were limited in terms of functionality and often led to confusing code, so, promises were introduced to deal with these problems.
  * A `promise` in JavaScript is similar to promises we do in real life. 
  * When we make a promise, it is guaranteed that in future, we are going to do something. 
  * A promise has two possible outcomes: it will be kept when the time comes, or it will not. 
  * Similarly, in JavaScript, when we define a promise, either it will be resolved when the time comes, or it will get rejected. 
  * According to MDN, “the Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.”
  * A promise has three states:
     1. pending: It is the initial state.
     2. Fulfilled: It indicates that the promised operation was successful.
     3. Rejected: It indicates that the promised operation was unsuccessful. 
  * The constructor syntax for a promise object is: 
    ```
    let myPromise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    // code here
    });
    ```
  * When new Promise is created, the function passed into it runs automatically. 
  * It contains the producing code which produces the result. 
  * Its arguments are resolve and reject. 
  * Example snippet:
    ```
    var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) { 
    const x = "Sanya"; 
    const y = "Sanya"
    if(x === y) { 
      resolve(); 
    } else { 
      reject(); 
    } }); 
    promise.then(function(){ 
    console.log('Success, Promise resolved.');}).catch(function () { 
    console.log('Some error occurred.');}); 
    // Here if the task is successful(x===y), the promise is resolved. 
    // If the task is unsuccessful(x is not equal to y), then the promise is rejected. 
    // The then() method is called if the promise is resolved
    // and the catch() method is called when the promise is rejected or if an error occurred during the code execution.
    ```
  * Promises are the ideal choice for asynchronous programming. 
  * Promises can handle multiple asynchronous operations easily and are better at error handling as compared to callbacks and events.

 ## Fetch API:
  * The Fetch API is a promise-based API of JavaScript for making asynchronous HTTP requests in the browser similar to XMLHttpRequest (XHR). 
  * Unlike XHR, the fetch API is a simple and clean API that uses promises to provides more powerful features to fetch resources from the server. 
  * Fetch API is standardized now and is supported by all modern browsers except IE. 
  * The fetch() method only has one mandatory argument: the URL of the resource that we want to fetch.
  * To use a Fetch API, just pass the URL, the path to the resource we want to fetch, to fetch() method. 
  * The syntax is:
  ```
  fetch('/js/users.json')
   .then(response => {
     // handle response data
   })
   .catch(err => {
     // handle errors
   });
  ```
  * We are using the then method to wait for the server's response. The catch() method is optional. 
  * #### We can extract the JSON from that response once the request completes:
    ```
    fetch('URL here')
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(json => console.log(json));
    ```
    * We start the request by calling fetch(). 
    * When the promise is fulfilled, it returns a response object, which exposes a json method. 
    * Within the first then(), we can call this json method to return the response body as JSON.
  * ### GET Request:
     * GET requests are widely used methods in APIs and websites. 
     * The purpose of this method is to retrieve data from the server at the specified resource. 
     * The Fetch API uses the GET method for asynchronous requests.
     * Example snippet:
      ```
      fetch('https://api.github.com/orgs/nodejs')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => {
      console.log(data) // Prints result from `response.json()` in getRequest
      })
      .catch(error => console.error(error))
      ```

  * ### POST Request:
     * The purpose of the post request is to send the data to the server and create a new resource. 
     * The resource post request creates subordinate to some other parent resource. 
     * When a new resource is posted to the parent, the API service will automatically associate the new resource by assigning it an ID. 
     * All we need to do is set the method and body parameters in the fetch() options.
     * Example snippet:
        ```
        let data = {
        first_name: 'John',
        last_name: 'Adams',
        job_title: 'Software Engineer'
        };
        const options = {
         method: 'POST',
         body: JSON.stringify(data),
         headers: {
         'Content-Type': 'application/json'
         }
        }
        fetch('https://reqres.in/api/users', options)
        .then(res => res.json())
        .then(res => console.log(res));
        ```

## Async/Await:
  * The functionality we can achieve using async functions can also be achieved by combining promises with generators, but async functions give us what we need without any extra complex code. 
  * As the async/await keywords were introduced in the newer version of JavaScript (ES8). Some older browsers may not support the use of async/await.
  * We use the `async` keyword with a function to represent that the function is asynchronous. The async function always returns a promise.
  * Syntax of async function:
    ```
    async function name(param1, param2, ...paramN) {
        // statements
      }
    
      // name - This is the name of the function
      // param – This is the parameters that are passed to the function
    ```
  * The `await` keyword is used to wait for the asynchronous operation. 
  * This keyword is used inside the async function. 
  * Syntax to use await is:
    ```
    let result = await promise;
    ```
  * The await pauses the async function until the promise returns a result value. 
  * When we want to call this function, we prepend await, and the calling code will stop until the promise is resolved or rejected. 
  * Example snippet:
    ```
    async function func1() {
      let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => resolve("Done with Async/Await!"), 1000)
      });
      let result = await promise; // wait until the promise resolves 
      console.log(result);
      }
      func1();
    ```
   * Benefits of using an async function:
       * Debugging using promises sometimes is very hard because the debugger will not step over the asynchronous code. But the Async/await makes this very easy because it is just like synchronous code to the compiler.
       * As we can see from the example above, the code looks very simple compared to the code using plain promises, with chaining and callback functions.
       * Error handling is simpler in async functions.
   

<hr/>

## Error handling and try catch:
 * Usually, a code immediately stops executing in case of an error, printing it to console. 
 * But we can solve this problem by using the try..catch statement. 
 * It allows us to "catch" errors so the script can do something more reasonable instead of stopping. 
 * ### Types of Errors:
   1. Syntax Error: 
       * This is the error in the syntax. 
       * For example, if we write console.lo('JS');, the above program throws a syntax error. 
       * The spelling of the log is a mistake in the above code.
   2. Runtime Error: 
       * The runtime error occurs during the execution of the program. 
       * For example, calling an invalid function or a variable.
      
 * ### Try Catch in JavaScript:
   * Just like other programming languages, JavaScript also has exception handling capabilities. 
   * JavaScript implements the try-catch statements as well as the throw operator to handle exceptions. 
   * The basic syntax for try…catch:
     ```
     try{//some code that has an error
      }
      catch (e) {
      //this will run if the code in the try block errors}
      ```
      * With these statements, in JavaScript, we can also add a throw or a finally clause. Let us see what role they play.
        * throw: This is a block of code nested within the try statement and allows the programmer to write their own error that they want to handle.
        * finally: This block of code runs once all the other statements have run.
    * `try/throw/catch`:
      * The throw operator generates an error. 
      * We can define and throw their own custom errors. 
      * When the throw statement is executed, the statements present after it does not execute. 
      * The control will directly pass to the catch block. 
      * In the following example, we create our own error ("This is a new error") in the throw block. 
      * Then try the code which throws an error which should be caught by the catch block.
        ```
        try{
        throw new Error ('This is a new error')
        }
        catch(error){
        console.log(error)
        console.log("End of try-catch block")
        }
        ```
    * `try/catch/throw/finally`:
      * Finally is an optional block of statements that is executed after the execution of try and catch statements. 
      * It does not matter that any exception is thrown or not, finally block code will definitely execute if it is present. 
      * In this example, we will see how to use the finally statement with the other three statements. 
      * In this example, we do not show the entire error. We just logged that the error has been handled in the catch block. 
        ```
        try{
        console.log("This statement works")
        throw new Error('This statement throws an error')
        }
        catch(error){
        console.log("Error has been handled")
        }
        finally{
        console.log("Everything has been handled")
        }
        ```
