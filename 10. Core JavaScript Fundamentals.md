## Event bubbling and capturing (trickling):
  * Event bubbling and capturing are two ways of event propagation in the DOM tree.
  * Bubbling up: Chlid->Parent->GrandParent
  * Trickling down: GrandParent->Parent->Child
  * If useCapture is true-> Captures/Trickles.
  * If useCapture is false-> Bubbles.
